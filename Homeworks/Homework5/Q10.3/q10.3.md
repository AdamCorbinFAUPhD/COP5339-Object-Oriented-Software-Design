1. The Decorator and Proxy patterns have an almost identical structure as defined by their class
diagram. What are the differences between these two patterns ?
    - Answer: The main difference is a Proxy patter will restrict access to the client vs a decorator pattern has the
    openness to implement as it chooses. You can think of the decorator pattern allowing the client to dynamically create its
    implementation on runtime where a proxy needs to determine the implementation on compile time.

    Adaptee's adapteeMethod()

## a
a) Explain the purpose of abstract classes in no more than 15 lines.

An abstract class is used to create a base set of interfaces with possible instance variables. 
This is really great when you might need to create many different kinds of objects that are different 
but there is a core set of functionality that you want to retain. An Abstract Class can also have implemented
methods so the children classes dont need to reinvent the wheel. This works great in a hierarchy mapping
of many classes that might want to inherit other methods or fields from the parent class.
 
## b
b) Give an example for a situation when an abstract class cannot be used 
in a Java program and an interface is the only choice.

Java doesn't have multiple inheritance so you can only extend a class with 1 abstract class. 
However, you can implement as many interfaces as you want to a class.

## c
c) GeneralPath collects shapes and is itself a shape. What design pattern does
it implement ? Explain.

This is an instance of a composite pattern since it contains instances of children classes. 
The GeneralPath is the main container that holds multiple other shapes and as a whole is considered
one object.

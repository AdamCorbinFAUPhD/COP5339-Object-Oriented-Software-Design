## a
Encapsulation is important to hide away unnecessary implementation details to the end users.
This will allow the user to focus on their end goal without having to worry about all the intermediate details
on how to get to the goal.

## b
As part of a contract there could be a precondition that assumes the user understands. If this contact/precondition
is broken then this is where an exception can be valid to be thrown.

### Example
There is a class foo which keeps track of a list of items. There can be a method of foo called remove. In this method we 
have a precondition/contract that states that you can not remove from an empty list. At this point if there is an empty
list and remove is called, then it would be ok to throw an exception that list is empty and nothing can be removed.

## c
Side Effects are basically methods that modifiy the state of an object or an input parameter. For example the next method in a list/iterator
will change the internal pointer to the current object. Side Effects should be avoid because it really can confuse users
as its not a typical way do implementing code. If Side Effects are used then make sure that its clearly documented.

## d 
And example of a bad interface design would be to have a Person class that would implement methods such has printAPage 
which should belong to a Printer class. This would be an example of Convenience but it conflicts with
Cohesion since printing of pages is not something a Persons class should do.
